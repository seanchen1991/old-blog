title: "About Me"
---

I'm a teacher at heart, currently of computer science and problem solving. I studied Applied Math at university, then went through Hack Reactor's sixteenth cohort as a means to transition into web and software development. 

My interests have since shifted towards systems programming, data structures, operating systems, programming languages, and things of that nature. I love fiddling with the elemental components upon which software and programming are built upon. 

My current programming language infatuation is [Rust](rust), though I also really enjoy branching out and learning about different programming languages and what makes them tick. [Haskell](haskell) and [Idris](idris) anyone?
