title: "About Me"
---

I'm a teacher at heart, currently of computer science and problem solving. I studied Applied Math at university, then went through Hack Reactor's sixteenth cohort as a means to transition into web and software development. 

My interests have since shifted towards systems programming, data structures, operating systems, programming languages, and things of that nature. I love fiddling with the elemental components upon which software and programming are built upon. 

My current programming language infatuation is [Rust](rust), though I also really enjoy branching out and learning about different programming languages and what makes them tick. [Haskell](haskell) and [Idris](idris) anyone?

Some projects I've been involved with:

- [exercism.io](exercism) is a platform that brings together students who are seeking to level up their skills in particular programming languages, and mentors who are experienced in those programming languages, giving both parties a streamlined way to provide feedback to one another. I'm helping to work on their Rust curriculum.
- [Pijama](pijama) is a functional programming language currently in very early stages of development. It's not intended to become a "serious" programming language, but it's real enough to grant me a front-row seat into seeing how real programming languages are created.
